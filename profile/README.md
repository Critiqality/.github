ðŸ§© **Critical tech for critical challenges, always searching for the missing piece** ðŸ§©

Welcome to **Critiqality**, a community of physicists and AI enthusiasts working at the intersection of deep tech and scientific discovery. Inspired by the wonders of physicsâ€”where critical points spark interconnected systems and emergent phenomenaâ€”we are developing innovative technologies to address global challenges. Our mission is to design solutions that reconnect humanity with nature, foster self-discovery, and harmonize innovation with the world we inhabit.

## About Us

Critiqality is a vibrant network of European scientists, researchers, and innovators passionate about translating the laws of nature into impactful technologies. Rooted in physics, information theory, and AI, we are building a stealth project that leverages critical technologies for global well-being in areas like efficient computing, climate tech, space tech, and health.

Our values:
- **Curiosity**: Driven by the joy of understanding.
- **Collaboration**: Fostering connections across disciplines.
- **Impact**: Creating technologies for a sustainable, harmonious future.

## Our Stealth Project

ðŸ§© **The bigger picture emerges while solving the puzzle** ðŸ§©

With over 15 years of expertise in Statistical Physics, Quantum Information, Deep Learning, and Scientific Computing, weâ€™re having fun at the interface of:
- Physics-based and nature-inspired AI solutions
- Hybrid Quantum-Classical Information Processing
- Energy-efficient Computing
- Multi-agent Collective Intelligence

Stay tuned for updates as we piece together this exciting project!

## Our Solutions

ðŸ§© **Assembling the deep tech ecosystem, one scientist at a time** ðŸ§©

To support our R&D, we offer solutions to connect young scientists, researchers, and innovators with the deep tech ecosystem. Our focus is on fostering technologies for global well-being, excluding applications like defense that destabilize the planet.

- **[Phase Transition](link-to-solution)**: Tailored guidance to help researchers and postdoctoral fellows transition from academia to industry roles, ensuring a smooth and informed career shift.
- **[Superposition](link-to-solution)**: Connects PhD and postdoctoral researchers with startups and deep tech companies for short-term, specialized missions, bridging academia and industry.
- **[Entanglement](link-to-solution)**: Creates inspiring environments for scientists from diverse fields to collaborate, spark ideas, and foster professional growth in natural or unique settings.
